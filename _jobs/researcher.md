The newly created ELLIS Unit of Alicante, Spain, is looking for postdocs, junior and senior researchers. [ELLIS](http://ellis.eu) (The European 
Laboratory of Learning and Intelligent Systems) is a European non-profit association whose objective is to attract, retain and nurture the 
next generation of excellent researchers in Europe in machine learning and related topics. In addition to excellent research, ELLIS aims 
to have positive economic and societal impact.
<!--more-->
Two open calls in the Fall of 2019 and Spring 2020 led to the establishment of a network of [27 ELLIS units](https://ellis.eu/units) in 13 
different countries. Together, these units bring together the best AI researchers at their locations and are connected with each other, 
creating a critical mass of excellent research centers across Europe and Israel.

The ELLIS Unit Alicante is a newly created non-for-profit Foundation called the "Institute for Human(ity)-centric Artificial Intelligence". 
It is devoted to three large research areas:

1. Computational modeling of individual and aggregate human behavior using machine learning techniques, including the area of leveraging such 
models for social good.

2. Development of intelligent, interactive systems, and particularly intelligent mobile systems and personal assistants.

3. Human-centric challenges in AI, such as algorithmic discrimination and opacity, computational violation of peopleâ€™s privacy, 
lack of veracity or the subliminal manipulation of human behavior.

The ELLIS Unit Alicante offers *competitive salaries* and a *flexible working environment* with no teaching load and close interactions both 
with universities and companies.

It is located in the University Campus of the University of Alicante, a beautiful mid-size Mediterranean city with sandy beaches, 
mild winters, excellent museums, international schools, a large international airport and world-class gastronomy.
