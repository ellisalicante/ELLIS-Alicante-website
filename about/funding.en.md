All the sponsorship levels will receive invitations to events organized by the ELLIS Alicante Foundation and to its inauguration event. Everyone will receive a distinctive pin and will be recognized in the Foundationâ€™s annual report, in addition to an explicit acknowledgement according to their level of sponsorship.

Every sponsorship level will qualify to receive attractive fiscal benefits given that they are donations to a non-profit Foundation devoted to scientific research.
