Everyone will receive a distinctive pin and will be recognized in the Foundation’s annual report, in addition to an explicit acknowledgement according to their level of sponsorship.

Every sponsorship level will qualify to receive attractive fiscal benefits given that they are donations to a non-profit Foundation devoted to scientific research.
