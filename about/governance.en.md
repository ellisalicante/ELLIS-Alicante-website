The **Trustees Committee** is composed of highly relevant individuals from an institutional, political, professional, business or social perspective. They act as ambassadors to the ELLIS Alicante Foundation with a particular focus on helping the Foundation identify new funding and collaboration opportunities. 

Finally, the board may appoint a director of the Foundation, with executive functions. The director will be responsible for the implementation of the Foundation's vision and mission. Depending on the profile, the director might also be in charge of the scientific leadership of the Foundation or a Scientific Director might be appointed by the board.
