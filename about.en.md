The scientific community of researchers in Artificial Intelligence Europe mobilized and 
created in 2018 a non-profit Association called [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu), the European Laboratory of Learning and Intelligent Systems. 
In December 2019 and after a competitive selection process, ELLIS announced the establishment 
of 17 ELLIS units in 10 countries in Europe and Israel. At that time the ELLIS network emerged 
with a commitment of more than 200 million euros of investment in research in the next 5 years. 
In June 2020, ELLIS announced the creation of 10 more ELLIS units, 
leading to a network of 27 units in 13 European countries and Israel.

### The goals of ELLIS

Attract, retain and cultivate the next generation of research talent in Europe. For this, 
it is necessary to address the main existing barriers, including the lack 
of competitive wages; the high teaching load; the rigidity of many academic environments 
in Europe that hinder the creation of startups and / or close collaboration with companies, 
and the fragmentation of research, generating islands of excellence and missing opportunities.
