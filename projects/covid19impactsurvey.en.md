The [Covid19ImpactSurvey](https://covid19impactsurvey.org) is one of the world's largest long-term surveys of public opinion on the impact of Covid-19 on society. It has focused on Spain, Italy, Germany, and Brazil, with more than 350,000 responses, capturing the progression of the epidemic from the peak of March 2020 until the second wave in November 2020. The survey continues with a goal of around 8,000 responses per week.

The preliminary results of the survey ([Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain: Large-Scale, Online, Self-Reported Population Survey](https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e21319/)) have been published in JMIR, the Journal of Medical Internet Research, one of the leading peer-reviewed journals in the field.

The questionnaire is available at [https://covid19impactsurvey.org](https://covid19impactsurvey.org). It is a short survey and can be answered in about 5-7 minutes.
